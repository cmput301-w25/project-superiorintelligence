## Project Part 4 Feedback

### Final Grade

7/8

### Feedback From Project Part 3

Some feedback was addressed.

### Code Base

All requirements completed. Data validation is present. Code base is not organized.

### Documentation

Some classes missing documentation about what the class is about.  Models have javadocs.

### Test Cases

Good work on the tests! This is a great improvement from the previous miletstone.

### Object Oriented Design

Some classes, like DeleteMoodFragment, are missing from the diagram. Composition and aggregation relationships should still have cardinalities. Fragments should have composition relationships with an activity.

### Backlog

Backlog is up to date.

### UI and Storyboard

UI mocks were updated for new features.

### Sprint Planning and Review

Comprehensive sprint plan and meeting notes are present.

### Demo 

The running joke about Seth was funny. The overall presentation could use more energy, and the presentation was overtime and could use some more rehersal.

### Tool Use

PR descriptions need to be improved, but otherwise good.

### Relative Quality

UI could be improved. The green colour is not super appealing. It's not always clear to the user what each button/options do.
