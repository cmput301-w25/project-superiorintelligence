## Project Description

This project is an Android application - Moodgram that allows users to post, track, and share their moods. The app is designed to provide insights into emotional states, triggers, and social contexts, ultimately helping users better understand and reflect on their mental well-being. Key functionalities include creating and managing mood events, controlling privacy, following other users to see their recent moods, attaching geolocation data, and filtering mood lists by various criteria.
## Key Features

## Feature 1: Mood Events

- **Creation, Editing, and Deletion:**
  - Users can add a new mood event with:
    - A **required emotional state** (anger, confusion, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, shame, or surprise)
    - The **current date and time**
  - Optional details include:
    - A **textual reason**
    - A **photo**
    - A **social situation**
    - **Geolocation** data

- **Public vs. Private:**
  - Mood events can be marked as:
    - **Public**: Visible to all participants
    - **Private**: Visible only to the creator

- **Consistent Visuals:**
  - Each emotional state is depicted with:
    - A consistent **emoticon**
    - A specific **color**
  - This ensures the app is intuitive and visually appealing.

## Feature 2: Mood History & Filtering

- **Reverse Chronological List:**
  - A userâ€™s mood events are displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

- **Filtering Options:**
  - Users can filter their mood history by:
    - **Date** (e.g., mood events from the last week)
    - **Emotional state**
    - A specific **keyword** in the textual reason

- **Offline Support:**
  - Users can add, edit, or delete mood events while offline.
  - Changes are synchronized once the device reconnects.

## Feature 3: Social Interaction & Following

- **User Profiles:**
  - Each user has a unique **username**.
  - Users can **search for other users**.

- **Following System:**
  - Users can request to **follow** other participants.
  - Users can **grant permissions** to followers.
  - Users can view the **three most recent public mood events** of the participants they follow.

- **Comments:**
  - Users can **comment** on mood events.
  - Users can view **all comments** associated with any particular mood event.

- **Maps Integration:**
  - The app can attach **locations** to mood events and display them on a map.
  - Includes a map that shows mood events from followed users as well as with an option to see your own mood events **within 5 km** of the current user's location.
  - Map can be filtered for different moods.
